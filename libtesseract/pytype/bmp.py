    '''BMP file header

     Notes:
      (1) The bfSize field is stored as a 32 bit integer and includes
          the size of the BMP_FileHeader, BMP_InfoHeader, the color
          table (if any), and the size of the DIB bits.
      (2) The bfOffBits field is also stored as a 32 bit integer and
          contains the absolute offset in bytes of the image data
          in this file. Some bmp files have additional data after the
          BMP_InfoHeader and before the color table (if it exists).
          However, enabling reading of these files makes the reader
          vulnerable to various malware attacks.  Therefore we do not
          read bmp files with extra data, and require that the size
          of the color table in bytes is
             offset - sizeof(BMP_FileHeader) - sizeof(BMP_InfoHeader)
      (3) Use arrays of l_uint8[] to make an endianness agnostic
          access to the BMP_FileHeader easier.
